## Style guide

People's names should be followed by parentheses containing either
1. a page reference (if the person is in the book); or
2. the person's birth and death dates (if they're not).

## LaTeX shortcuts

Biography headers:

	\biohead{Full Name}{Photo caption; if non-empty a portrait will be displayed.}

Index entries (plain; for more complicated ones do the usual things):

	\idx{text to both display and index}

Page references:

	\p{LABEL} outputs e.g. "p. 3"

## Tree (SVG) conventions

Names in 11pt, dates 9pt; all `serif`.

Indent continued-line names with three spaces.
