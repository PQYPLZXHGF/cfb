Ralph was educated at Cheam and Felsted School, and Birkenhead School. He joined the Alliance Insurance Company to train as an actuary, but left the company on joining the army at the beginning of the war. He served as a Private soldier throughout the war.

They  bought Kerrow Farm in West Penwith in 1965 where they farmed (dairy and beef cattle) for five years.
