He married Nora Katie Munday (\p{Nora_Katie_Munday}) on 8 November 1916 at the Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Street, London. \cite{NoraMundayMarriage}  He was an officer in the colonial police, and he and Nora went out to Ghana (then the Gold Coast). They travelled up country and visited areas in which the native population had never seen a white woman before. As was the case with many colonial administrators, his health was damaged by his service and he died in about 1925 after retiring and settling in Devonshire. They had no children; Nora did not remarry.

He died in early 1927 at the age of 46.\cite{FrederickWestbrookDeath}
