Eric Geoffrey West Hancox (or `Geoffrey' to his family) was a geologist. He did his undergraduate studies at the University of Liverpool and the Imperial College of Science London University, before moving to Canada and the US in the 30s to gain his PhD. He died in 1937 in a mining accident in Burma.

Geoffrey was born in August 1911 \cite{EGWHbirth} in Rock Ferry, to Richard and Marian Hancox, and christened on 10 September.\cite{EGWHchristening}

He arrived in New York on the ''Scythia'' on 11 September 1934 (he was listed on the ships manifest as a student \cite{Scythia}). The following year he went into the US from Canada, to Babb, Montana, and is listed as a student at both the University of California and the University of Arizona in Tuscon \cite{EGWHborder} where he was a Commonwealth Fund scholar (now the `Harkness Fellowship'; at the time this was akin to a Rhodes Scholarship, but for foreign students studying in the US).

The following is an article from the front page of the \emph{Casa Grande Dispatch} newspaper of Tucson, Arizona on 25 May 1934. \cite{CasaP1}

\textbf{Recognition Given U Of A By British}

TUCSON May 18

International recognition of the strength of the department of geology at the University of Arizona and of the wealth of field research opportunity in the state has come through the announcement that a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship has been awarded to an English student for specific graduate study at the University of Arizona. President [[Wikipedia:Homer L. Shantz|Homer LeRoy Shants]] of the University indicated today that the selection of the University of Arizona for one of these school places its department on an equal plane with the great centers of study in that field. The fellowship has been awarded to Eric Geoffrey Hancox, a graduate of the University of Liverpool and of the Imperial College of Science, London University.
