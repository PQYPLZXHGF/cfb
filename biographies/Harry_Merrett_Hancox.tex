\biohead{Harry Merrett Hancox}{}

Harry Merrett Hancox was born on 15 April 1868 	Everton, Lancashire, at 23 Woodville Terrace, Everton, Liverpool, to Harry Hancox (\p{Harry_Hancox}) and Maria Mary Merrett (\p{Maria_Mary_Merrett})\cite{HMHancoxBirth}.  He had three brothers, Frank Heeley Hancox (\p{Frank_Heeley_Hancox}), Charles Edward Hancox (\p{Charles_Edward_Hancox}) and Richard James Hancox (\p{Richard_James_Hancox}).

In 1901 he was living with his family at 30 Edge Lane, Liverpool, Lancashire, and worked as a Bankers Clerk \cite{HMHancoxOccupation}.

In 1911 he lived at 11 Central Park Avenue, Liscard, Wallesey, Cheshire, and was still a Bank Clerk \cite{HMHancoxResidence}. At that time, Harry was living as a boarder, age 42, so it is probable that he never married. 

He died on 22 June 1943 in Southport, Lancashire, England \cite{HarryMerrettHancoxDeath} and the Probate notice read:
