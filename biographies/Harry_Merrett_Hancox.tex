Harry Merrett Hancox was born on 15 April 1868 	Everton, Lancashire, at 23 Woodville Terrace, Everton, Liverpool, to Harry Hancox (1836--1885) and Maria Mary Merrett (1845--1908)[HarryMerrettHancoxBirth].  He had three brothers, Frank Heeley (1870--1909), Charles Edward (1872--1952) and Richard James (1873--1956).

In 1901 he was living with his family at 30 Edge Lane, Liverpool, Lancashire, and worked as a Bankers Clerk [HarryMerrettHancoxOccupation].

In 1911 he lived at 11 Central Park Avenue, Liscard, Wallesey, Cheshire, and was still a Bank Clerk [HarryMerrettHancoxResidence]. At that time, Harry was living as a boarder, age 42, so it is probable that he never married.
